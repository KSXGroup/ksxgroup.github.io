To tackle these challenges, we proposed a deep meta learning based model, entitled ST-MetaNet+ , to collectively predict traffic in all locations at the same time. ST-MetaNet+ employs a sequence-to-sequence architecture, consisting of an encoder to learn historical information and a decoder to make predictions step by step. Specifically, the encoder and decoder have the same network structure, consisting of meta graph attention networks and meta recurrent neural networks, to capture diverse spatial correlations and diverse temporal correlations, respectively. Furthermore, the weights (parameters) of meta graph attention networks and meta recurrent networks are generated from the embeddings of geo-graph attributes and the traffic context learned from dynamic traffic states. Extensive experiments were conducted based on three real-world datasets to illustrate the effectiveness of ST-MetaNet+ beyond several state-of-the-art methods.","tags":[],"title":"Spatio-Temporal Meta Learning for Urban Traffic Prediction","type":"publication"}]
